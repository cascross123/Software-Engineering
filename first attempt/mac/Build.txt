At this time, the newest SDK version that Audacity can build with is 10.6. 
To build Audacity using Xcode 5.1 or newer, you need to extract the 10.6 SDK
from an earlier version of Xcode.

In the instructions below, Xcode 4.3.3 (for the 10.6 SDK) and Xcode 5.1.1 will
be used.  Xcode 6.1.1, 6.3, 6.4.1, and 7.1 have also been verified to work. 
Xcode 7.2 and later require a custom build setting to accept the 10.6 SDK, or 
to edit src\MemoryX.h in the Audacity code. See this topic:
http://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?p=303835#p303835 .

1) Download Xcode 5.1.1 or greater and install it to /Applications.
2) Download Xcode 4.3.3 (it includes the 10.6 and 10.7 SDK's despite 
   the downloads page says it only has the 10.7 SDK).
3) Open the DMG in Finder.
4) Right-click the "Xcode.app" bundle and select "Show Package Contents".
5) Navigate down the directories to get to:

   Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/ .

6) Copy the MacOSX10.6.sdk folder to:

   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/

   Xcode is now ready.

7) Download wxWidgets 3.0.2 fron the wxWidgets project: 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.2/wxWidgets-3.0.2.tar.bz2 .

   Don't be tempted to use Widgets already installed by a package manager such 
   as Homebrew because this may cause problems.              

8) Once the download is complete, untar it (your browser may do this itelf):

   tar xf wxWidgets-3.0.2.tar.bz2 .

9) Apply the following fixes to wxWidgets:

   cd wxWidgets-3.0.2
   patch -p0 -i <path to Audacity source>/mac/wxMac_additions/wxMac-3.0.2-fixes.patch .
   patch -p0 -i <path to Audacity source>/mac/wxMac_additions/eventloops.patch .
   patch -p0 -i <path to Audacity source>/mac/wxMac_additions/pinch-spread.patch .
   patch -p0 -i <path to Audacity source>/mac/wxMac_additions/focusrings.patch .
   patch -p0 -i <path to Audacity source>/mac/wxMac_additions/wxMac-3.0.2-wxaccessible.patch .
   patch -p0 -i <path to Audacity source>/mac/wxMac_additions/tooldock-quit.patch .

10) And finally build/install wxWidgets:

   sudo <path to Audacity source>/mac/build_wxwidgets .

You should now be able to build Audacity using either the Xcode application or 
the Xcodebuild command line tool. 

* Using xcodebuild, build Audacity and create DMG and ZIP bundles in 
  /private/tmp by typing the following in the terminal:

  xcodebuild -configuration Release install   

* If you use the Xcode application, don't make any changes to 
  Audacity.xcodeproj recommended by Xcode. In particular, be sure to leave the
  Base SDK configuration set to 10.6 as it is now. 

If you need Audacity to show languages other than English, install the gettext
suite of tools (to get the msgfmt command).  The source can be downloaded from:

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/gettext-latest.tar.gz

Untar it:

   tar xf gettext-latest.tar.gz

And install:

   cd gexttext-latest
   ./configure
   sudo make install
